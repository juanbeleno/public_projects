# NSF Research Awards Abstracts

This dataset comprises several paper abstracts, one per file, that were furnished by the NSF (National Science Foundation). A sample abstract is shown at the end.

Your task is developing an unsupervised model which classifies abstracts into a topic (discover them!). Indeed, your goal is to group abstracts based on their semantic similarity.

You can get a sample of abstracts here. Be creative and state clearly your approach. Although we don’t expect accurate results but a good pipeline of your work.

It is affordable to create a notebook, like Jupyter (if you use python) or a Rmarkdown report (in case you use R) and make it available for us, i.e. github.

Hint to success in your quest: Develop and stay clear of the data science process you'll perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects you might consider affordable to discuss over.

Aside notes: All fields in every abstract file wouldn’t be needed. Be keen.
Good luck and have fun.

Abstract :
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are an important algorithmic
device in a variety of fields. This project studies techniques for rigorous
analysis of the convergence properties of Markov chains. The emphasis is on
refining probabilistic, analytic and combinatorial tools (such as coupling,
log-Sobolev, and canonical paths) to improve existing algorithms and develop
efficient algorithms for important open problems.
Problems arising in
computer science, discrete mathematics, and physics are of particular interest,
e.g., generating random colorings and independent sets of bounded-degree
graphs, approximating the permanent, estimating the volume of a convex body,
and sampling contingency tables. The project also studies inherent connections
between phase transitions in statistical physics models and convergence
properties of associated Markov chains.
The investigator is developing a new graduate course on MCMC methods.
